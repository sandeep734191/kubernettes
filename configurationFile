Every configuration file contains three parts
 1.metaData
 2.specification
 3.status
 
 STATUS is automatically generated and added by kubernettes.Kubernettes will always compare desired state and actual state and it will generate status.
 
 Desired state is present in SPECIFICATION part in configuration file
 Actual state is present in ETCD (etcd holds the current status of anyk8s components). so kubernettes gets actual state from etcd.
