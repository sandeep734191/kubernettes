kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pod
kubectl get services

note: cannot interact with pod directly so a abstraction is present over it which is deployment

kubectl create deployment <name> --image=<imageName>

ex:kubectl create deloyment nginx-deployment --image=nginx

kubectl get deployment -> will show above created nginx-deloyment
kubectl get pod -> now shows nginx-deployment container

Between deployment and pod there is replica set which manages the replicas of pod

kubectl get replicaset -> ex:nginx-deployment-<id of replicaset>-<id of pod>
